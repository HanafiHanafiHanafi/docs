Consensus serves as a method to reach agreement on a shared state. For the\ncontinuous progression of the blockchain's state, all nodes within the network must collectively agree and achieve consensus. This consensus mechanism is essential for decentralized\nnetworks, ensuring synchronization among nodes. In the absence of consensus in a decentralized blockchain network, there is no guarantee that the state acknowledged by one node\naligns with the perspectives of other nodes.
